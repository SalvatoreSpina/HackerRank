# Hacker Rank

Just a wrapper repository for some of the Hacker Rank challeges I completed.

## Disclaimer

- Vast majority of them include bad habits like *"#include bits/stdc++.h"* or *"using namespace std"*; I know they're bad but they are part of the enviroment given by HackerRank.

- Only the code written by myself will be in this repository (= not by HackerRank environment). For more info regarding the problem, every single file is named exactly like the challenge on HackerRank and easily foundable.

- No official test will be submitted, due to potential plagiarism problems.
